This data is from the kaggle.com survey data from 2021. Kaggle.com is an online plaform for learning, networking, competitions, and discussions on all things data science and machine learning. Kaggles users are a wide range of demographics from all around the world. Kaggle sends a survey to it's users yearly to get a better understanding of thier users. 

More information on the survey can be found in the attached PDF documents. 

## Questions: ##
- What is the effect of a persons demographics on the amount of time they spent on the survey?
- Gender, Location, Sex, Age, Years of Exp. Vs Time Taken
- Could a prediction be made to detrimine the time taken based on theses demographics?
- Could this be used to check the validity of a users survey? 

## EDA plan
- I would like to plot bar graphs showing the number of respondants in each group
- Plot bar graphs of the demographic vs the time taken
- Eliminate outliers
- Check siginficance
